## Overview

This package contains assignments and examples used by the Biomedical Software Engineering course
taught at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine by [Prof. Arthur Goldberg](https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/arthur-p-goldberg).

The course teaches software engineering skills that enable efficient creation and ongoing improvement of effective biomedical software.
We cover skills that students apply to a current biomedical informatics project, and expose students to advanced software engineering methods and skills that they can apply and develop over their professional lives.
