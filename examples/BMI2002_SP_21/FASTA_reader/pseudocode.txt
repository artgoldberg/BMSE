Pseudocode:
class
  define valid extensions

  init(pathname):
    save pathname
    validate()
    ## invariant: validated

  validate():
    error if pathname not string
    error if pathname doesn't point to file
    error if pathname wrong suffix
    return self

  read():
    open fasta pathname
      (what should be done if file cannot be accessed?)
    # read fasta file
    new list of sequences
    while (more lines)
      ## invariant: preparing to read next sequence
      error if next line does not start with '>'
      error if next line does not exist or DOES start with '>'
      ## invariant: ready to read non-empty sequence
      initialize next sequence
      while (next line exists and does not start with '>'):
        error if line is not nucleotides
        add line to sequence
      ## invariant: created non-empty sequence with nucleotides
      add sequence to list of sequences
    return list of sequences

Comments:
   This approach supports chaining, eg:
      sequences = FC(pn)read()
