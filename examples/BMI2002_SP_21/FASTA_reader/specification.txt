Problem requirements from Week 10 lecture
o Robust FASTA file reader
   - Legal FASTA format
      FASTA file suffixes (extensions) include fasta, fna, ffn, faa, and frn
      Lines that start with ‘>’ describes sequence that follows
      All other lines must contain nucleotide codes
      A sequence can span arbitrarily many lines
o FASTA file reader class
   - Input pathname to a FASTA file
   - Provide error if the FASTA file is bad
      Input pathname not a string
      Input pathname doesn’t identify a file
      Input pathname doesn’t use a legal FASTA file suffix
      File doesn’t follow FASTA file format
   - If the FASTA file is good
      A method should return a list of the sequences in the file
